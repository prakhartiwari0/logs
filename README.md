Learned the basics of Testing in JS

</summary>

**The Odin Project**
 - Completed [Testing Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-basics)
	 - 1.  [Read this short article](https://web.archive.org/web/20211123190134/http://godswillokwara.com/index.php/2016/09/09/the-importance-of-test-driven-development/)  that outlines the basic process and the benefits of TDD.
	- 2.  Watch at least the first 3 videos of  [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zVEGEvSaeF_zoW9o66wa_UCNE3a7BEr)  about testing in JavaScript. The first video focuses heavily on the WHY, while the next two go into more depth about the process. Later videos in the series are  _definitely_  worthwhile, but the first 3 are enough to get you up and running.
	- 3.  Read and follow the  [Getting Started](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)  tutorial on the main Jest website.
	- 4.  Read and follow the  [Using Matchers](https://jestjs.io/docs/using-matchers)  document on the main Jest website. This one demonstrates some of the other useful functions you can use in your tests.
